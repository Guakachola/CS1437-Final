This is just my CompSci Project. 2nd Sememester Freshmen Year at University of Houston, 
Computer Science 1437, the second class to 1336. It was a C++ text based project, where I
imatated a Tamagotchi game that works and is kinda fun to play. Just putting it on here to
keep and show on my website. I plan on porting this to JS one day, to make it playable on my
website since WebAssembly sucks. :)
